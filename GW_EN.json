In contrast, actinides show slightly higher electronegativity than lanthanides on some scales due to relativistic effects. The relativistic effects occurs in heavy atoms, when inner electrons move near light speed, increasing their mass and pulling outer electrons closer. This boosts nuclear attraction slightly, making actinides seem more electronegative. However, the expansion of d- and f-orbitals also occurs in relativistic effects means they are less tightly bound to the nucleus, that may effectively reducing the nuclear attraction on these orbitals.

The Allred-Rochow scale tells a clearer story: electronegativity drops from chromium to molybdenum as atoms get bigger and nuclear pull weakens, but then rises again for tungsten. Why? Poor shielding by f-electrons in tungsten lets the nucleus pull harder on bonding electrons.

Yet, its Allred-Rochow value is the highest, reflecting strong nuclear attraction on the outer electrons. Typically, Allred-Rochow electronegativity decreases down the group due to increasing atomic size. However, mercury defies this trend, showing a slightly higher value than cadmium\u2014a result of poor f-electron shielding, which intensifies nuclear pull. For copernicium, only Allred-Rochow data is available. The bar of copernicium is Allred-Roschow electronegativity and it is to be lower than mercury as bar of mercury shows Pauling electronegativity. However, when Allred-Rochow electronegativity of coperniucium and mercury is compared, the copernicium 's electronegativity value is slightly higher than mercury\u2019s. Though larger in size, its electronegativity is higher than mercury\u2019s, likely due to powerful relativistic effects. In heavy atoms, the intense nuclear charge causes inner electrons to approach light speed, increasing their mass and contracting the s and p orbitals. This contraction enhances nuclear attraction for bonding electrons, giving copernicium a surprisingly high electronegativity\u2014defying classic trends and highlighting the unique behavior of superheavy elements.",

Indium continues the expected downward trend due to its larger radius and better shielding, but thallium takes a slight upward turn. Why? Blame the ineffective shielding of f-electrons, which boosts its nuclear attraction. As for nihonium, direct Pauling or Mulliken values are unavailable. Using Allred-Rochow data, it was expected to fall below thallium, but instead, its electronegativity surpasses thallium\u2019s\u2014a likely result of relativistic effects enhancing orbital contraction and nuclear attraction.

        "Analysis":"Group 17 (the halogens) follows a clear electronegativity trend influenced by atomic size and shielding effects. Fluorine, the most electronegative element, has a small atomic radius and a strong nuclear pull. As we move down to chlorine, bromine, and iodine, electronegativity decreases due to increasing atomic size and electron shielding, weakening the nucleus' hold on bonding electrons. Astatine continues this trend but is slightly stabilized by relativistic effects. Tennessine is expected to have the lowest electronegativity in the group as depicted by Allred-Roschow value, though its exact values of Pauling and Mulliken remain unknown. The bar of tennessine is Allred-Roschow electronegativity and it is to be lower than astatine as bar of astatine shows Pauling electronegativity. However, when Allred-Rochow electronegativity of tennessine and astatine is compared, the tennessine's electronegativity value is lower than astatine, as increasing atomic size counteract relativistic effects. This trend highlights how atomic structure shapes an element\u2019s ability to attract electrons!",

However, krypton and xenon can form compounds, showing measurable electronegativity. Fluorine\u2019s extreme electronegativity allows it to pull electrons from xenon in compounds like XeF\u2082. Electronegativity decreases down the group as atomic size increases and nuclear attraction weakens. Radon is expected to have an even lower value due to relativistic effects. For oganesson, electronegativity remains uncertain but is predicted to be very low due to strong relativistic influences and a highly diffuse electron cloud.",
