Its electron is close to the nucleus with no other electrons in the way, so it takes a lot of energy to snatch it away \u2014 that\u2019s why hydrogen has the highest ionization energy in Group 1. As we step down from lithium to cesium, each element adds a new electron shell, making the outermost electron easier to steal because it\u2019s farther from the nucleus and shielded by inner electrons. This weaker attraction means less energy is needed to remove the electron, and ionization energy decreases. But wait \u2014 francium breaks the trend! Despite being below cesium, francium has a slightly higher ionization energy. Why? It\u2019s all about relativistic effects. Francium\u2019s 7s electron is pulled closer to the nucleus due to its high atomic number (heavier than cesium), making it a little harder to remove than cesium\u2019s 6s electron. So, francium might be the king of Group 1 in terms of size, but it still holds onto its electron tighter than cesium!",

Iridium, however, shows a significant increase in ionization energy compared to rhodium, primarily due to the lanthanide contraction phenomenon, where poor shielding from filled 4f orbitals results in a stronger effective nuclear charge pulling the 5d electrons closer to the nucleus. For meitnerium, the value of ionization energy is unavailable.

Boron has the highest ionization energy due to its small size and strong effective nuclear charge. Gallium has a slightly higher ionization energy than aluminium because of poor shielding by the 3d electrons. Indium follows the expected decrease, but thallium unexpectedly shows a higher ionization energy than both indium and aluminium. This anomaly is due to a combination of relativistic effect as Thallium is heavy element and lanthanide contraction caused due to ineffective shielding by the intervening 4f electrons, which increase the effective nuclear attraction on the outermost electron, making it harder to remove. For atoms with larger masses, electrons are compelled to move at higher speeds. This results in them being closer to the nucleus, which in turn makes them more difficult to remove (leading to a higher ionization energy). The ionization energy of nihonium is unavailable.

        "First_to_seventh_IE_Analysis":"Helium, with an electron configuration of 1s2, has an exceptionally high first ionization energy due to its extremely small size and the tightly bound nature of its two electrons in a full 1s subshell. Its second ionization energy is even higher, as it involves removing the last electron from a very stable, highly positive single-electron ion. Each successive ionization energy (though only two for Helium as there are ony two electrons present in helium atom) increases dramatically because the remaining electrons are held much more tightly by an increased effective nuclear charge. For Helium, both its first and second ionizations are already \"core\" electron removals in effect."
