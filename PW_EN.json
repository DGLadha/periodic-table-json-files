        "Analysis":"Electronegativity generally increases across a period from left to right due to the increasing nuclear charge, which pulls electrons closer, and the relatively constant shielding effect, as electrons are added to the same energy level. This results in a smaller atomic radius, enhancing the nucleus' ability to attract bonding electrons. However, Period 1 of the periodic table consists of only hydrogen (H) and helium (He). Pauling electronegativity of hydrogen is 2.2 while that of helium is no defined since it is a noble gas and does not typically form bonds. Helium does not have an electronegativity value because it is chemically inert and does not readily attract electrons in a bond. However, Allred-Roschow and Mulliken electronegativity shows an increase. This is due to the way their values are calculated. Helium has higher effective nuclear charge and high ionization enthalpy as compared to hydrogen, thus, Allred-Roschow and Mulliken values shows an increase in their values respectively.",

This is due to increasing nuclear charge and decreasing atomic radius, which strengthen the attraction for bonding electrons. The shielding effect remains nearly constant, so the effective nuclear pull grows steadily. Fluorine tops the Pauling scale as the most electronegative element (3.98), followed closely by oxygen and nitrogen. Carbon, though in the middle of the period, shows a sharp jump due to its small size and strong nuclear pull. Neon doesn\u2019t have a Pauling value\u2014since it doesn\u2019t form bonds\u2014but its Allred-Rochow electronegativity is known and surprisingly slightly higher than fluorine\u2019s. This oddity arises because the Allred-Rochow scale reflects electrostatic attraction, not bonding. Neon\u2019s small atomic radius and high effective nuclear charge lead to a strong attraction for nearby electrons\u2014even if it doesn\u2019t bond. The bar of neon shows Allred-Rochow electronegativity and is lower than fluorine\u2019s, whose bar shows Pauling electronegativity. However, when comparing Allred-Rochow values directly, neon\u2019s electronegativity is slightly higher than fluorine\u2019s, despite neon being inert.\n",

        "Analysis":"As we move across Period 3 from sodium to argon, electronegativity increases on both the Pauling and Allred-Rochow scales. This happens because the nuclear charge increases, pulling electrons more strongly, while the atomic radius decreases and shielding remains relatively constant. The result? Atoms become better at attracting bonding electrons. Elements like sulphur and chlorine stand out with high electronegativities, thanks to their smaller sizes and stronger nuclear pull. Phosphorous and silicon fall in the middle, and the metals\u2014sodium, magnesium, and aluminium\u2014show relatively low values, as expected. Now, argon presents an interesting case. While Pauling electronegativity is unknown for argon due to its lack of bonding behavior, its Allred-Rochow value is known\u2014and surprisingly, it\u2019s higher than that of chlorine. This seems odd, but the explanation lies in argon\u2019s small size and high nuclear charge, which give it a strong electrostatic pull on electrons, even though it doesn't actually form bonds. Since Allred-Roschow electronegativity depends on the effect nuclear charge, that is why argon shows its higher value as compared to chlorine. The bar of argon shows Allred-Rochow electronegativity and is lower than chlorine\u2019s, whose bar represents Pauling electronegativity. However, when comparing their Allred-Rochow values directly, argon\u2019s is slightly higher\u2014likely due to its small radius and strong nuclear attraction.\n",

        "Analysis":"Across Period 4, electronegativity generally increases from potassium to bromine, driven by increasing nuclear charge and decreasing atomic radius, which enhances the ability of atoms to attract bonding electrons. However, the journey isn\u2019t smooth. Between scandium (21) and zinc (30), the transition metals show fluctuations in electronegativity. This is due to d-orbital interactions, which affect shielding and electron distribution, leading to irregular trends compared to main group elements. Bromine, near the end of the period, has a high electronegativity as expected for a halogen. But then comes krypton, a noble gas, and things get interesting. Though Pauling electronegativity isn\u2019t defined for krypton (since it rarely forms bonds), its Allred-Rochow electronegativity is known\u2014and surprisingly, it\u2019s higher than bromine\u2019s.

        "Analysis":"In Period 5, electronegativity generally increases from rubidium (Rb) to iodine (I). This trend follows the classic pattern: nuclear charge increases and atomic radius decreases across the period, leading to a stronger pull on bonding electrons. However, the trend isn\u2019t perfectly smooth. From yttrium (Z=39) to cadmium (Z=48), the transition metals cause fluctuations in electronegativity. These irregularities arise from d-orbital electron interactions and shielding effects, which make the nuclear attraction less predictable in this part of the period. Iodine, being a halogen, has a high electronegativity and fits the expected trend. But what really stands out is xenon. Although xenon is a noble gas, it can form compounds under extreme conditions (like xenon difluoride), so it has a Pauling electronegativity value of 2.6\u2014slightly lower than iodine, reflecting its limited bonding tendency.But here's the twist: Xenon\u2019s Allred-Roschow and Mulliken electronegativities are actually higher than iodine\u2019s. This seems odd at first, but it\u2019s explained by xenon\u2019s high nuclear charge, compact atomic size, and very high ionization enthalpy. These factors boost xenon\u2019s electrostatic pull on electrons\u2014even if it doesn\u2019t readily form bonds. The bar of xenon shows Allred-Roschow electronegativity and the bar is lower than iodine\u2019s, whose bar shows Pauling electronegativity. When comparing their Allred-Roschow values directly, xenon\u2019s is clearly higher, likely due to its stronger nuclear attraction and relativistic effects, despite its noble gas status.\n",

At the end of the period, radon, a noble gas, doesn\u2019t have a Pauling value due to its inertness. But its Allred-Roschow electronegativity is higher than astatine\u2019s, which is surprising.

The bar of radon shows Allred-Roschow electronegativity and it is lower than the bar of astatine\u2019s, which shows Pauling electronegativity. Comparing their Allred-Roschow values directly, radon is slightly higher due to relativistic contraction and high effective nuclear charge, despite being chemically inert.",

However, since Period 7 consists mostly of actinides, transition metals and radioactive elements, many Pauling and Mulliken electronegativity values are unknown. Therefore, Allred-Roschow electronegativity is used for those elements. The Pauling electronegativity increases from actinide. However, after actinide, the Pauling electronegativity is unknow for the transition metals series IV, therefore, their Allred-Roschow electronegativity is compared with that of actinide. The electronegativity of transition metal is higher than that of actinide following the regular trend of increase in electronegativity across the period due to high effective nuclear charge. The Allred-Roschow electronegativity continues to increase till flerovium. After flerovium, there is notable irregularities in the electronegativity. It decreases from flerovium to livermorium and then increases from tennessine to oganesson. The variation is due to strong relativistic effects which is generally observed for heavy and superheavy elements. These effects arise from extremely high nuclear charges that cause inner electrons to move at speeds close to light, leading to orbital contraction and altered chemical behavior.",
