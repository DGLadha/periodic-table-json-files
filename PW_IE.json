Helium has a much higher first ionization energy than hydrogen. This is because helium has two protons in its nucleus (versus hydrogen\u2019s one), creating a stronger pull on its electrons. Both elements have electrons in the same shell (1s), but helium's electrons experience very little shielding and are pulled in more tightly. Moreover, helium has a fully filled 1s orbital, which is exceptionally stable, making it even harder to remove an electron.

        "Analysis":"Across Period 2, from lithium (Li) to neon (Ne), the general trend for first ionization energy is an increase. This is primarily due to the increasing nuclear charge (number of protons) as you move from left to right. With more protons, the attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons strengthens, pulling the electrons closer and making them harder to remove. However, there are two notable exceptions to this general trend. The first drop occurs from beryllium (Be) to boron (B). Beryllium has a stable, fully filled 2s subshell, making it relatively difficult to remove an electron. Boron, on the other hand, has its outermost electron in a higher-energy 2p orbital, which experiences slightly more shielding from the inner 2s electrons and is, on average, further from the nucleus, thus requiring less energy to remove. The second exception occurs from nitrogen (N) to oxygen (O). Nitrogen has a stable, half-filled 2p subshell (one electron in each 2px, 2py, and 2pz orbital). Oxygen, however, has an electron pair in one of its 2p orbitals, leading to electron-electron repulsion. This repulsion makes it easier to remove one of these paired electrons from oxygen, resulting in a lower first ionization energy compared to nitrogen, despite oxygen having a higher nuclear charge.",
        "First_to_seventh_IE_Analysis":"Lithium's first ionization energy is relatively low, as its single valence electron in the 2s orbital is shielded by two inner 1s electrons. However, the second ionization energy increases sharply, as it involves removing a core 1s electron that is much closer to the nucleus and strongly attracted. The third to seventh ionization energies are extremely high, reflecting the increasing difficulty of removing deeply held core electrons.\n\n"

Additionally, since all valence electrons in Period 3 are in the third main energy level, the shielding effect from inner electrons remains relatively constant, further intensifying the effective nuclear charge. However, similar to Period 2, two notable \"dips\" or decreases in ionization energy occur. The first is from magnesium (Mg) to aluminium (Al). Magnesium's outermost electrons are in a stable, filled 3s subshell, while aluminium's outermost electron is in a higher-energy 3p orbital, which is less attracted to the nucleus and experiences slightly more shielding from inner shell electrons. The second dip is observed from phosphorus (P) to sulfur (S). Phosphorus has a stable half-filled 3p subshell (one electron in each 3p orbital), whereas sulfur has an electron pair in one of its 3p orbitals. The electron-electron repulsion between these paired electrons in sulfur makes it easier to remove one of them, counteracting the increased nuclear charge and resulting in a lower first ionization energy for sulfur compared to phosphorus.",

Generally, as you move from left to right across Period 4, the first ionization energy tends to increase, primarily due to the increasing nuclear charge. However, this increase is not as smooth as in Periods 2 and 3. The filling of the 3d orbitals in the transition metals (Scandium to Zinc) introduces a more subtle and less predictable change in ionization energy. While the effective nuclear charge generally increases, the shielding provided by the 3d electrons can vary, leading to slight irregularities in the trend. After the d-block, the p-block elements (Gallium to Krypton) resume the more pronounced increasing trend due to the continued increase in nuclear charge and the effective filling of the outer p-orbitals. Similar to earlier periods, there are also \"dips\" in the ionization energy, such as from Calcium to Scandium. In scandium, an electron enters a 3d orbital while calcium has fully filled s-orbital, a stable electronic configuration due to which it is harder to remove electron from calcium than scandium) and from Zinc to Gallium (as the electron now enters a 4p orbital after the complete filling of the 3d subshell in Zinc, experiencing greater shielding and being easier to remove). A slight dip is also observed from Arsenic (As) to Selenium (Se). Arsenic has a stable half-filled 4p subshell (4p3), making it relatively harder to remove an electron. Selenium, with its 4p4 configuration, has an electron pair in one of its 4p orbitals, leading to electron-electron repulsion that slightly outweighs the increased nuclear charge, thus making it easier to remove an electron compared to arsenic. The general rule of increasing nuclear charge and decreasing atomic radius holds, but the filling of the d-orbitals and the stability of half-filled subshells introduce a more nuanced pattern.",

This trend is driven by the increase in nuclear charge, which pulls electrons closer to the nucleus, making them more difficult to remove. However, the trend is not perfectly smooth due to the presence of transition metals (Y to Cd), where electrons are added to the inner 4d subshell. These d-electrons provide poor shielding, so the increase in ionization energy is relatively modest across the d-block. The presence of the d-block elements in Period 5 also introduces complexities due to the filling of 4d orbitals, which can affect shielding and penetration effects. A clear example of an exception to this trend is observed between Cadmium (Cd) and Indium (In). Cadmium has a stable electron configuration with completely filled 4d and 5s subshells ([Kr]4d105s2), making it relatively difficult to remove an electron. In contrast, Indium has its outermost electron in the 5p subshell ([Kr]4d105s25p1). This single 5p electron is in a higher energy subshell and is shielded by the filled 4d and 5s orbitals, making it easier to remove than an electron from Cadmium's highly stable, filled 5s subshell, thus resulting in a lower first ionization energy for Indium compared to Cadmium.",

Cesium and barium, with their large atomic radii and weak nuclear pull on valence electrons, have very low ionization energies. As we move across the 5d transition metals (from hafnium to mercury), the ionization energies rise slowly due to increasing nuclear charge, though the shielding by filled 4f electrons (from the preceding lanthanides) is poor, allowing the nuclear pull to increase. The lanthanide contraction, a gradual decrease in ionic radii across the 4f block, also contributes to higher ionization energies in the 5d series than expected. Entering the p-block, from thallium (Tl) to radon (Rn), ionization energies rise more clearly, though there is a notable anomaly: bismuth (Bi) has a slightly lower ionization energy than lead (Pb). Although, the reason for this anomaly is not clear, however, it might be due to stronger relativistic effects in lead, which contract and stabilize the 6s orbital more than in bismuth, making Pb\u2019s outer electrons harder to remove.Overall, the Period 6 trend is shaped by a complex interplay of nuclear charge, poor shielding by f-electrons, orbital penetration, and relativistic effects, leading to both general increases and unexpected drops in ionization energy.",
        "First_to_seventh_IE_Analysis":"Cesium has one loosely held 6s electron, so its first ionization energy is extremely low. The second ionization requires removing a 5p core electron, which is much closer to the nucleus, resulting in a very sharp increase. The third to seventh ionization energies continue to rise rapidly as electrons are removed from inner subshells of 5s and 4d, which are tightly bound due to minimal shielding and high nuclear attraction.\n\n"

Critically, direct experimental measurements of ionization energies for elements from Nihonium (Nh, Z=113) to Oganesson (Og, Z=118) are currently unknown due to their extreme instability and scarcity. Theoretical predictions for these elements indicate significant deviations from simple periodic trends, largely due to relativistic effects that drastically alter orbital energies.
