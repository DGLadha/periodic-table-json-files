The d-orbitals have low shielding ability, causing the outer electrons to be more strongly attracted to the nucleus, resulting in a gradual decrease in atomic radius. However, from nickel to zinc, the atomic radius increases due to electron-electron repulsion in the 3d subshell. As more electrons occupy the 3d orbitals, inter-electron repulsion counteracts the nuclear attraction, leading to a slight expansion in atomic size. This effect is more pronounced in zinc, making its atomic radius larger than that of copper."
